 lina itself is released under version 2 of the GNU General Public License.
 However, this is a compiler and a substantial part of the package
 are for all practical purposes libraries.
 The GPL only applies to the compiler build as a derivative work of
 the lina.s source and saved configurations of lina, not to compiled
 programs.
 All other usage, in particular of the library forth.lab and binaries
 build by lina, are made available under the Lesser GNU General Public License.
 This even applies to applications that have the Forth interpreter
 exposed, provided they are truly applications.

 [lina is an instance of a Forth build by the ciforth compiler factory.
 Different conditions (essentially none) apply to a Forth that you
 build yourself using that tool.]
