@section                        Legalese
This application currently is copyright by M4_SUPPLIER.
This Forth is called ciforth and is made available by the
DFW.
This publicationis is available under GPL 2, the GNU public license.
The file forthfile({COPYING}) containing the legal expression of these
lines must accompany it.

You can make closed source program with the -c options.
Such programs are naturally your own,
quite the same as programs build with the gcc compiler.
However also if you base an application program on ciforth,
you need not make its source available,
even if the application contains the Forth interpreter
exposed. This would be a derived work and,
in a strict interpretation of the GPL,
such interpretive systems based on ciforth
are always legally obliged to make the source available.
Because Forth is ``programming by extending the language'' ,
we consider this ``normal use in the Forth sense'' as
expressed by the following statement.

In addition to the GPL M4_SUPPLIER grants the following rights
in writing:

forthenumerate
forthitem
The GPL is interpreted in the sense that a system based on ciforth and
intended to serve a particular purpose, that purpose not being a
``general purpose Forth system'', is considered normal use of the
compilation system, even if it could accomplish everything ciforth
could, under the condition that the ciforth it is based on is
available in accordance to the GPL rules, and this is made known to
the user of the derived system.

forthitem
Code snippets in the library inasfar not in the public domain
are available under the LGPL, so you can freely borrow from it
or build on it.

@section                         Rationale

This Forth is meant to be simple.
What you find here is a Forth for the Intel 86.
You need just the executable to work.
You choose the {format} you prefer for the documentation.
They all have the same content.
You can use the example
file with blocks,
you have the assembler source for your Forth,
but you can ignore both.

@section                         Source
In practice the GPL
 means (note: this is an explanation and has no legal value!)

They may be
further reproduced and distributed subject to the following conditions:

The three files comprising it must be kept together and in particular
the reference section with the World Wide Web sites.


The latest version of thisforth is found at
forthbreak
forthurl({http://home.hccnet.nl/a.w.m.van.der.horst/ciforth.html}).

Via that link you can also download ciforth's for other OS's and
the generic system, if you want to make important modifications.
Also you can see how you can contact the author.
Otherwise in case of questions about this ciforth, contact the person or
organisation that generated it for you.

This Forth builds on figforth. It is based on the work of
Charlie Krajewski and Thomas Newman, Hayward, Ca. still
available via taygeta. The acknowledgments for systems that
serves as a base, in particular the original figforth, are
found in the generic documentation, including detailed
information how these systems can be obtained.

forthemph({Important:})
forthbreak If you just want to use a Forth,
you most certainly do not want the generic system.
Great effort is expended in making sure that this
manual contains all that you need, and nothing that might
confuse you. The generic system on the contrary contains lots
that you don't need, and is confusing as hell.

If you are interested in subjects like history of Forth,
the rationale behind the design and such you might want to read the
manual for the generic Forth.
@section The Generic System this Forth is based on.

The source and executable of this ciforth was generated, out of at
least dozens of possibilities, by a generic system.
You can configure
the operating system, memory sizes, file names and minor issues like
security policy. You can select between a 16, 32 and 64 bit word size.
You may undertake more fundamental changes by adapting one or more of
the macro header files.
An important goal
was to generate exactly fitting documentation, that contains only
relevant information and with some care your configuration will have
that too.
This generic system can be obtained via
forthurl({http://home.hccnet.nl/a.w.m.van.der.horst/ciforth.html}).
