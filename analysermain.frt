\ The main part for analysing high level code.
\ This code is common to the initial analysis and analysis of high level
\ additions.

\ ------------------------ DATA DESIGN ----------------------------------
\ >FFA leaves the flag field that is considered an area of 4 bytes.
\ >FFA 0 + gives the dummy, invisible, immediate and denotation bits.
\ bits 4..7 are available and used here.
\ >FFA 1 + : any bits set open up an optimisation opportunity.
\ >FFA 2 + reserved for the return stack effect nibbles.
\ >FFA 3 + gives the data stack effect nibbles:
\ high nibble : input:  1-- 0E depth popped +1
\ low nibble : output: 0 = unknown , 1-- 0E depth pushed +1
\ 0 = unknown , 0FH = variable.
\ A ``STACK EFFECT'' is a pair (input nibble, output nibble) with the above encoding.
\ A ``pure stack effect'' is a pair (depth popped, depth pushed).

\ A code definition ( not ``:'' and not ``DOES>'') may be a type if the

\ There are several motivations for this lookup table:
\  1. CONSTANT's and VARIABLE's have the FMASK-NS optimisation which
\      doesn't follow from an automatic analysis.
\  2. Reanalysing for each same code field is a waste of time.
\  3. The analyser works (partly) independantly of the dissassembler.
\  4. If multi-threading is used the automatic analysis is right for
\      USER's, however normally they can have the FMASK-NS optimisation.
\ The user only needs to fill in the stack effect of his code words, to forego
\ the need of loading the assembler.
