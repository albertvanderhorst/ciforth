Test report of generic forth's for Intel 86 family.
First part for ISO forth's, in the appendix some figforth's.

Summary
This is a test report for 12 out of a zillion Forths that can be
generated from fig86.gnr and ci86.gnr .
Only the hosted version have a a automated regression test.
The booting version take more time to test.

However, please tell me if any of the following tests fails
you, where it doesn't fail me.
It looks as if sometimes K' fails. But not for a freshly booted system.
If you have observation with regard to this, or even insight, or even
a fix, I urge you to inform me.

Stable version 5.3.0
For Debian (linux)  64 and 32

Stable version 5.2.0
For Debian, Windows XP and Apple OSX.

Stable version 5.1.0  Suse ( and XP)
Still s| and D| conflivt in the assembler. error 13 retained.

Stable version 5.0.0  Suse ( and XP)

Stable version 4.0.6  Suse and XP

The redirection on XP doesn't work for the command interpreter:
it takes over the file from which commands are read unconditionally,
and doesn't head the /c option and the subsequent commands.
TICK on MSDOS, see 4.0.5

Stable version 4.0.5  Suse and XP

MEASURE-PRIME on the Celeron works flawlessly now. (The reason it failed
was not the lack of instruction 0F 31.). MEASURE-PRIME on MSDOS fails to
the effect that TICK 's is not implemented on MSDOS (yet).

Stable version 4.0.4  Suse and XP
This stable version was used internally because it had improvements related
to timing, and was never officially released and tested.

Stable version 4.0.3  Suse and XP
The XP version failed the MEASURE-PRIME because it was a Celeron
system without the clock count instruction 0F 31 .
(Apparently for some other reason because the Celeron has that instruction.)

Stable version 4.0.1  Suse

Test are always mentionned if applicable. A failed test is preceeded
by -. Not all tests are always down.

The following environments are defined (Only for BOOTFD BOOTHD):
I nasm version , Booted from FD or HD
II nasm version, started from MSDOS
III build with MASM 1.0 , Booted from FD or HD
IV  build with MASM 1.0 , started from MSDOS
III
(Other environments following from the executable itself).
Notes about ommitted data:
- all linux versions use NASM  PROTECTED BITS32
- all booting versions use NASM BIOS
- the MASM versions all are MSDOS-hosted and real mode

This table can be used to decide whether you want to run
an older better tested version. Data for older versions
is not present if the new version passed all tests the older
one does.
FAILED TESTS ARE PRECEEDED with -.

This test is for the ISO ciforth , version 3.###

ONLY THE LATEST VERSION OF lina IS TESTED for snapshots.
The latest versions of other configurations are trustworthy, because
the changes only relate to the general part.

Versions are 3.xxx unless a dot is present.

N.A. : not available.
L* :

1) This requires a special CONFIG.SYS/AUTOEXEC.BAT to free memory <64K
2) O and P not tested, because these version have no redirection.
3) Editor is sometimes unreliable ^U hangs.
4) Only Postscript file fails.
5) Most editor commands work ^T fails or a hangup occurs.
6) Floppy is extremely slow.

an older better tested version. Data for older versions

Version 2.114 apparently in alone3 cannot handle screen deleting lines, otherwise
reasonable.
Version 2.147 has the same assembly source file than 2.148 whereever it has
been tested. (Modification was needed for alonehd.cfg.
Afterwards 2.148 has been checked in and it was
checked that the source was equivalent to the one tested. (i.e. after
removing comment lines the source was the same, or differed at most
with respect to strings printed.)
All MASM version generate real code. I have to boot into MSDOS to test this
so these are really old version.

N.A. : not applicable.
L* :
The classic version has been tested after properly setting OFFSET to
compensate for the fact that the BLOCKS.BLK was not simple dumped on
the floppy from sector 0. In that case the MSDOS directory would not
have remained intact.
