SYNOPSIS
lina -- 32 bit figforth for linux
BLOCKS.BLK -- contains blocks for lina
toblocks.c fromblock.c -- convert block file to/from text file

DESCRIPTION
`lina' is the linux version of the generic 86 figForth generated from
ci86.gnr.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENT
The binary distribution `lina' runs without modification on any i86 linux.
Building requires the nasm assembler.

FILES
Blocks are allocated in the file BLOCKS.BLK in the
current directory. Run time switching to an other file is possible.

SOURCE
lina can be generated from its source `lina.asm' by
    nasm lina.asm -felf -o lina.o
    ld lina.o -o lina
The conversion programs can be generated by
    make toblocks fromblocks
The info file can be generated by
    make ci86.lina.info
and used by
    info -f ci86.lina.info

SYSTEM PROGRAMMING
If you need the value of mysterious symbolic constants in c
you can add them in the file stealconstant.c.
After
    cc -E stealconstant.c | m4 prelude.m4 - > constant.m4
you will find the value in constant.m4.
Sometimes you will find you need to add extra include directories
here, e.g. ``-I/usr/include/asm''.
The prelude.m4  is taken from
the generic system.
But a file prelude.m4 containing only
changequote({,})dnl
will do.

SEE ALSO
There is a ci86.lina.html that is generated with
ci86.lina.texinfo from a common source, and partly from the
program source. Installation information is present too, but
should go into a separate manual.

"Linux kernel internals". Forth-ers need mainly Appendix A.

CAVEAT
This is a beta release.
BLOCKS.BLK is generic and contains source that may not run
on lina. In particular not the nice screen editor.
