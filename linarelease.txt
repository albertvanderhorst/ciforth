SYNOPSIS
lina -- 32 bit ISO (ANSI)forth for linux
forth.lab -- contains blocks used as a library
toblock.c fromblock.c -- convert block file to/from text file

DESCRIPTION
`lina' is the linux version of the generic 86 Forth generated from
ci86.gnr version 4.0

SYSTEM REQUIREMENT
The binary distribution `lina' runs without modification on any i86 linux.
Building requires the nasm assembler.

FILES
Blocks are allocated in the file forth.lab in the
current directory. Run time switching to an other file is possible.

SOURCE
lina can be generated from its source `lina.asm' by
    nasm lina.asm -felf -o lina.o
    ld lina.o -o lina
The conversion programs can be generated by
    make toblocks fromblocks
The info file can be generated by
    makeinfo --no-split ci86.lina.texinfo -o ci86.lina.info
and used by
    info -f ci86.lina.info

SYSTEM PROGRAMMING
If you need the value of mysterious symbolic constants in c
you can add them in the file stealconstant.c.
After
    cc stealconstant.c
    stealconstant > constant.m4
you will find the value in constant.m4.
Sometimes you will find you need to add extra include directories
here, e.g. ``-I/usr/include/asm''.

SEE ALSO
There is a ci86.lina.html that is generated with
ci86.lina.texinfo from a common source, and partly from the
program source. For special installation requirements see
the generic system.

CAVEAT
forth.lab is generic and parts are configured to not load
on lina. In particular not the nice screen editor.
